# DailyStats

DailyStats is developed in UIKit and is a life status tracking app.

## Features
It enables the user to create questions that will be posed daily and can be answered either through yes/no or from a scale of 1-5. The responses are tracked and stored locally. Specific behaviors for each day (e.g. drank alcohol, exercized, etc.) can be added to each day to later get a better understanding what behaviors evoke what answers.

## Maintenance
Some views/constraints are deprecated and need to be updated.
